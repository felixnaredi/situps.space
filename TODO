# TODO

In general, when code is being tinkered with it is not too uncommon to find or think of (tangential)
improvements. This file aims to quickly gather such ideas. So that they don't distract from the
current goal, or worse, become forgotten.

### TODO:
  It would actually be worth while for Typescript interfaces to be automaticly generated by the
  event structures written in Python.
  - VALUE: 4, ESTIMATE: 8

### TODO - Server:
  The error handling is sloppy. It should be clear when errors are thrown because the request was
  bad and what went wrong.
   - VALUE: 4, ESTIMATE: 3

### TODO - Server:
  The boilerplate needed to create database and event structues is causing too much bugs. The
  debugging is hurting the velocity.

  It would be worth a moderate to large amount of effort to lessen it. Third party libraries,
  annotations and clever interspection are all welcome. They are only required to store data so it
  should be possible.

  Too be clear. Writting them goes fast and they are readable. It is the time debugging every 
  minor change to them that is expensive.
  - VALUE: 7, ESTIMATE: 7

### TODO:
  Look into MongoDB schemes.
  - VALUE: ?, ESTIMATE: ?

### TODO:
  It would probably not be a bad idea to add a task board to the project. Just to keep track of 
  things.
  
  The board would not be a replacement of this file though. This file servers other purposes.

### SECURITY:
  Typing a non integer value (floating point number or text) in the input text field setting the
  `amount` of a entry causes *Internal Server Error 500*.

  Either make it clear to the user on the frontend that the value is invalid or prevent non integer
  values to be entered. Or some combination.

  - SEVERITY: Low
    - Since it causes error messages in the log of the server and in the browsers console it could
      potentially obfuscate other errors.

### BUG - components/UserDayInput.vue
  Clearing a input field doesn't change the background color until it is blured.

### TODO
  Change the name of `components/UserDayInput` to something better.

### TODO - Design
  Each week, Monday to Sunday (darn... way in the future localization will be necesarry), should be
  separated vertically. There is probably room to add a label of the week number.

### TODO - UX
  The app could be made much more versitile by letting users add new weekly goals. Too keep things
  simple, just changing the header (the one that currently says "Situps") to another name would
  suffice. Of course the content of the entries changes accordingly but strictly talking UI the
  behavior would be identical.
